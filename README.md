# from SLR to phone, from Lightroom to Kouki2

I've been using Lightroom for photo management since Lightroom v1. As I moved to make more and more photos using phone, I realized that I do not use Lightroom features that much. And the features which I really like phone integration are missing. After looking at number of alternatives such as Apple Photo, Google photo, Photoprism, Librephotos or Photosync, I could not an app which fits.

Key things I am looking for are:
- work with existing photo archive structure, including albums, export folders etc
- one click transfer from the phone
- one click archive of duplicate photos from the phone to hard drive while removing them from the phone
- flexible photo management on a computer (and a phone)
- no service cost

Installation:
- TBD
